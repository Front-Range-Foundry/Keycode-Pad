# Keycode-Pad
Rust control-flow and shadowing practice by building a simple keycode application. 

# What should it do? 
- It generates a random number of size 6, called the_code 
- This number can be accessed through a get_code function 
- Takes two user inputs - get_code and enter_code. 
- get_code returns the current code. 
- enter_code checks a user input against the_code. 
- the user has three opportunities to enter the code correctly. 
- if they fail, the_code is reset. 
- and the user's guess count is reset as well.
